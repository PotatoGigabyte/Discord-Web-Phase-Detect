# Discord-Web-Phase-Detect
About:
I made this discord web scraper which is a google extension and when a pre-determined phrase is sent in a channel thats open, it opens the pre-determined link.

Usage:
Once installed to google chrome extension, open the discord web page (if you had it open refresh). Once open naviagate to the channel you want to detect from. If you click the extension you will see a popup where you can type phrases (each phrase is a line) and the url you want to open once the phrase is detected. Toggle on the "Monitor Active" button to activate it. Once it detects the phrase it will open the link and if you have sound on it will play a sound. After each use it toggles the "Monitor Active" to off.

Example:
Having a discord alert chat with this bot for example for Pokemon Center drops allows you to get first in queue the moment the product drops.
